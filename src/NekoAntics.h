/* The curious half of roaming.

   Wandering from place to place is what the cat does; this is what makes it
   look interested in you. Every so often it drops what it was doing, comes over
   to the pointer and asks what you are writing, or pounces on the cursor, or
   goes to claw the edge of the screen.

   What it goes on comes from NekoDesktop: counters the system hands out with no
   permission at all — keys and mouse moves since boot, seconds since the last
   one — plus, if that switch is on, the text being worked on.

   What it says comes from whichever engine Ask Neko is set to, asked while the
   cat is still walking over, with written-in lines as the fallback for when
   there is no engine or it does not answer in time. */

   People keep a distance from an agent that attends to them, and the closer and
   more head-on the attention, the more they compensate — measured with robots,
   and the same instinct applies to a cat that lands on the caret. So the spot is
   an arm's length away and to one side. Public because the geometry is worth
   testing without a screen.

   Typing fast is what sends it over in the first place, so it may well still be
   happening when it arrives: this is the number that decides whether it says
   anything or thinks better of it and leaves. */
