/* Finding the lines of a diary that bear on a question.

   The diary is a month of short lines and the prompt has room for about three of
   them, so the whole problem is which three. Until now the answer was "the newest
   three", which is right for a follow-up and wrong for everything else: something
   decided three weeks ago was written down and then never found again.

   **Why this is words and not a model.** The plan said to embed every line with
   `NLEmbedding`, which is on the machine and needs no permission. Measured on a
   staged Italian diary of twenty lines and ten questions, before any of it was
   built:

   | | top-1 | top-3 | a month costs | on disk |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | NLEmbedding, cosine | 5/10 | 5/10 | 5.5 s | 3.7 MB |
   | bare shared words | 8/10 | — | — | — |
   | lemmas + word class + rarity | 8/10 | 8/10 | 267 ms | nothing |
   | the two fused by rank | 6/10 | 9/10 | 5.5 s | 3.7 MB |

   The embedding lost to counting words, and fusing the two bought **one question
   in ten** on top-3 — which is inside the noise of a ten-question sample — for
   twenty times the time and 3.7 MB of vectors sitting beside a file whose whole
   promise is that it is plain text somebody can read. So: no embedding. If recall
   turns out to be weak in use, that table is where to start arguing with this
   decision, and the fusion is four lines of code.

   Three things do the work, all of them from NLTagger, all of them in the four
   languages this application speaks:

   1. **Lemmas.** "Ascolto" and "ha ascoltato" are the same word asked twice.
   2. **Word class.** A question is about its nouns; the verbs it is asked with —
      usare, fare, avere — are how a language carries a question. Nouns count 1.0,
      adjectives 0.8, verbs and adverbs 0.35, and the rest not at all.
   3. **Rarity.** A word that is in every line of the diary says nothing about
      which line. Plain inverse document frequency, the cheap half of BM25.

   And one rule decides whether a line is about the question at all: **it has to
   share a word of substance** — a noun, a name, a number, an adjective. Measured:
   of eight questions about things not in the diary, six came back with a line, and
   five of those six shared exactly one word, which was `fare`, `essere` or `come`.
   A verb is how a question is carried, not what it is about.

   What it cannot do is synonyms: asked about *"impostazioni"* it does not find
   *"preferenze"*. That is measured, it is in `tests/recall.m` as a known miss
   rather than hidden, and it is the one thing a sentence embedding was better at —
   fifth of twenty, which would still not have reached a prompt with room for
   three.

   **The obvious fix was tried and does not work**, and it is written down here so
   that the next person tries something else. `NLEmbedding` also has *word*
   vectors, with a neighbours call, which is the natural way to widen a question:
   take each word somebody asked about and add what is nearest to it. Measured on
   this Mac, Italian, 49,620 words:

   | pair | distance | wanted |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | gatto ↔ cane | **0.660** | out — a different animal |
   | gatto ↔ coniglio | 0.659 | out |
   | caffè ↔ tè | 0.865 | out |
   | riunione ↔ assemblea | 0.859 | in |
   | problema ↔ difetto | 0.898 | in |
   | **versione ↔ release** | **0.922** | **in — the same thing, two words** |
   | riunione ↔ votazione | 0.971 | out |
   | treno ↔ aereo | 1.106 | out |
   | impostazioni ↔ preferenze | 1.157 | in |

   There is no threshold. The pairs that should widen a search span 0.70 to 1.16
   and the pairs that must not span 0.66 to 1.11, and two different animals sit
   closer together than two words for the same thing. That is not a flaw in the
   vectors: distributional similarity means "turns up in the same sort of
   sentence", which is exactly why a cat and a dog are neighbours, and it is not
   what synonymy means. Apple's Italian vectors also read *preferenze* in its
   voting sense — its neighbours are *voto, votante, consenso* — so the pair that
   started all this would have missed anyway.

   The system dictionary was tried next and is a dead end for a different reason.
   `DCSCopyTextDefinition` **is** reachable from inside the sandbox, which is
   worth knowing on its own — but it answers with a definition, not a list of
   synonyms, and an Italian dictionary opens *impostazione* on its architectural
   sense and never mentions *preferenze* at all. Parsing lexicographic prose to
   find a synonym is a larger and worse idea than the problem.

   What has not been tried, and is the better idea: **the person's own diary as
   the source.** Words that turn up in the same lines are related for them, in
   their vocabulary, and an expansion drawn from what somebody actually wrote
   cannot import a concept from outside it. It needs a real month of diary to
   measure honestly, which is why it is not in here on a hunch. */
