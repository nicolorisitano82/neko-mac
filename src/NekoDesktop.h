   somebody asks for — see NekoGlance.h, and docs/one-look-roadmap.md for why the
   shape mattered more than the capability. The key is gone rather than left
   declared: a defaults key nothing reads is a thing the next person has to work
   out is dead. */

/* How good a moment this is to say something.

   Interruptions cost about ten minutes of task switching plus another ten or
   fifteen before the original work resumes, and the cost depends on when they
   land: at a breakpoint in the activity it is measurably lower, and the coarser
   the breakpoint the cheaper it is (Iqbal & Bailey, CHI 2007/2008). These are
   the breakpoints that can be seen from application switches, typing rate and
   idleness alone — no screen reading, no permission. */

/* What the cat can tell about your day, in one place.

   Two tiers, deliberately separated. The first needs no permission at all and is
   what the suggestions and the antics have always run on: which application is
   in front, how long you have been in it, how often you have been switching, how
   fast you are typing and moving the mouse, how long since you last touched
   anything, the time. Counters and timestamps, never content.

   The second tier is content, and is off until you turn it on: the text in the
   field you are typing in, or under the pointer, read through the Accessibility
   API. Password fields are refused, secure keyboard entry silences it entirely,
   and what comes back is trimmed to a few hundred characters. With a remote
   engine chosen, that text is sent to that service — which is why it is a
   separate switch with its own paragraph rather than a detail of another one. */
