/* Turns what you say into text, and nothing else.

   The microphone opens when listening starts and closes when it stops: there is
   no hot word and no background capture. Recognition runs on the device when
   the language allows it, and says which mode it is in rather than leaving the
   user to guess.

   Speech is weakly linked, since SFSpeechRecognizer arrived in macOS 10.15 and
   this project still builds for older systems, where the whole feature is
   simply unavailable. */
