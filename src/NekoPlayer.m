#pragma mark Being allowed to

/* This is the second design. The first one asked macOS directly —
   AEDeterminePermissionToAutomateTarget with askUserIfNeeded NO, which is
   documented as answering from the consent database without prompting — and the
   Permissions tab froze the whole application the moment it was opened.

   Measured, not guessed: sampling the stuck process gave 1723 samples out of 1723
   in the same place, the main thread inside
   AEDeterminePermissionToAutomateTarget waiting on a dispatch semaphore. That
   function needs the run loop to deliver the reply it is waiting for, and the main
   thread is what services the run loop, so calling it there is a deadlock rather
   than a slow call. No timeout would have helped: it never returns.

   So nothing is preflighted at all. Neko finds out the same way a person does — by
   trying, once, at a moment somebody chose — and remembers the answer. A recorded
   yes came from a command that worked; a recorded no came from macOS answering
   -1743. That is strictly more honest than a preflight: it cannot claim a
   permission that would not actually work. */
