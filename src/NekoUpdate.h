/* Telling you a new version exists, and then getting out of the way.

   This application goes out as an **unsigned** disk image, which decides the
   shape of everything here. A signed application can replace its own bundle and
   relaunch; an unsigned one that tried would hand you a copy Gatekeeper refuses
   to open, having already thrown away the copy that worked. So this does not
   install anything, ever:

       1. it asks GitHub, once a day, what the newest release is;
       2. if that is newer than this, it says so — in the cat's menu, and once
          out loud;
       3. it asks whether to download, with the size, before fetching anything;
       4. it downloads with a progress bar, and can be cancelled;
       5. it asks again before doing anything with the file;
       6. and then it opens the disk image and quits, so that the copy you are
          about to drag across is not the copy that is running.

   **The installation is yours.** Drag Neko into Applications, the way you did
   the first time. That is one step more than a self-updater and it is the step
   that makes the other five safe.

   What the check reveals, stated plainly rather than buried: one HTTPS request
   to api.github.com, carrying no diary, no question, and nothing about you
   except what any web request carries — your address, and the fact that
   something asked. It sends no identifier of its own. The switch is in the Pet
   tab and turns the whole thing off; it is on by default because an unsigned
   application that cannot tell you it is out of date is worse than one that
   asks a public API for a version number.

   And what it does **not** promise: this checks a version number, not a
   signature. The assurances are TLS and the address it asks, and after that it
   is a disk image you look at yourself before dragging anything. Nothing here
   verifies the download, because nothing here could — an unsigned build has
   nothing to verify against. */
