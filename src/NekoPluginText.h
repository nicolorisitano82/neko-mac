/* NekoPluginText */

#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>

/* Passing text through a plugin, on its way in or on its way out.

   The mechanism is one of the user's own Shortcuts, and that is the whole reason
   this is allowed: the Shortcut is theirs, nothing new runs inside this app, and
   the plugin names a Shortcut rather than a program.

   Four rules, and they are the interesting part:

   1. **It can change words and nothing else.** Whatever comes back is text that
      will be shown or asked. It cannot become a deed: if the returned text
      carries one of the app's markers — ACTION:, IMAGE:, LOOK: — the whole
      transformation is thrown away rather than cleaned up, because a plugin
      reaching for a marker is a plugin doing something it was not given.
   2. **It never blocks the conversation.** A Shortcut that is slow, missing or
      broken means the original text, unchanged, after the timeout.
   3. **It sees the words and nothing around them.** Not the diary, not the
      instructions, not what the cat noticed, not where you are.
   4. **What you said is what is remembered.** The diary records the words that
      were spoken; the transformed version is what the engine is asked. */
