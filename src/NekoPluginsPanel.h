/* The plugins window.

   Its own window rather than a seventh tab in the preferences, for two reasons.
   The preferences are settings — things about how the cat behaves — and a plugin
   is not a setting, it is a thing somebody installed. And this window has to say
   more than a tab has room for: what each plugin adds, what it is allowed to do,
   why a refused one was refused, and the sentence about what none of them can
   reach. That paragraph belongs where somebody is deciding whether to trust a
   folder they downloaded. */
