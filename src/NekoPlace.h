/* Roughly where this Mac is, and nothing finer than that.

   Two tiers, and the first needs no permission at all: the time zone says which
   country somebody is in, which is enough to know that "the news" means an
   Italian wire rather than a British one.

   The second tier is the town, and it is worth a permission because it is what
   makes "che tempo fa" answerable without naming a city and "che notizie ci
   sono qui" mean anything. It is asked for only when somebody presses the button
   for it, one fix at a time, at the accuracy macOS calls reduced — a few
   kilometres, which is a town and not a street.

   What is kept is the *name* of the town and of the region, in the defaults, as
   text. The coordinates are used to look those two up and then dropped: there is
   nowhere in this app where a latitude would be useful, and a file with somebody's
   latitude in it is a different kind of file. Nothing is sent anywhere — the
   lookup is Apple's, on the system; the weather asks open-meteo for a town by
   name, which is what a person would have typed. */
