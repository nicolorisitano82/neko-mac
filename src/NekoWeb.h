/* Headlines, from a list somebody else cannot add to.

   The dangerous version of this feature is the obvious one: let the model name a
   web address and fetch it. Then a sentence on a page — or in a headline, or in
   a document somebody sent — can send the cat anywhere, and text nobody in this
   room wrote decides what gets downloaded. So the model does not name addresses.
   It names one of the entries below, by a word from a fixed list, and anything
   else is refused before a connection is opened.

   What comes back is treated the same way as text read from the screen: quoted
   data, never instructions, and an answer built on it may not perform anything.
   That last rule lives in NekoAsk and has a test of its own.

   The request carries nothing: no question, no account, no cookies, no history —
   an ephemeral session, one GET, eight seconds. What ANSA can see is that
   somebody fetched a public feed. */
