/* Hands the question to a Shortcut the user owns and reads back what it put on
   the clipboard.

   The Shortcut is where the intelligence lives, and it is the user's choice:
   Apple Intelligence's "Use Model" action, which can escalate to ChatGPT, a
   ChatGPT action, or anything else that ends in text. Nothing here talks to a
   model, holds a key, or opens a socket.

   The clipboard is the return channel because it is the only one that costs no
   permission: a file would mean a folder the user has to grant. Whatever was on
   the clipboard before is put back afterwards. */
