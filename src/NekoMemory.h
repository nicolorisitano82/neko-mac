/* What the cat remembers, and where you can go and read it.

   A day at a time, in plain text, in the app's own Application Support folder:
   what it noticed, what it said, what you said back. Plain text is not laziness —
   it is the only honest form for a file about somebody. You can open it, you can
   see exactly what is there, and you can delete it with the Finder if you do not
   trust the button.

   Three tiers, each one shorter-lived and larger than the next. Once a day the
   previous day is reduced to at most a handful of dated lines — "works late on
   Tuesdays", "the deadline is Friday" — and the daily files are kept for thirty
   days and then removed, since by then they have been read. When a dated line
   itself turns thirty days old it is not thrown away either: it goes through a
   second pass with everything else that is expiring, and what survives becomes a
   *standing* line, undated, of which there are never more than a dozen. "Ships on
   Fridays." "Would rather be told than asked."

   That is the shape the memory literature converged on — a small working set, a
   consolidated store, reflection over the reflections — and the reason for the
   second pass is that the alternative is what this used to do: silently drop the
   oldest line once there were forty of them.

   Nothing is deleted for age without having been read first. If there is no
   engine to read with, the lines wait rather than going: only a hard ceiling, far
   above the usual, ever drops one unread.

   Two rules hold without exception. The reflection is written by whatever
   NekoBrains says is the best engine on this Mac, which is never a remote one.
   And a remembered line is not an instruction: it came from a document or a
   window once, so it can inform what the cat says and can never authorise
   anything. */
/* Where the diary is, when it is not where it lives.

   Not a preference and not in any window: nothing in the application ever sets
   it. It exists because the test suite used to write into the **real** diary and
   that is how a fault got in — `tests/memory.m` stages lines carrying its own
   marker and takes them out again, but while they were in there the advisor read
   them in a memory block and said one out loud, and `noteSaid` wrote that down
   where the marker could not reach it. `zzq-test` became "test zqqmark", then
   "test barge", "test boat" and "test chiatta", and sat in every prompt for a
   week. `tools/diary.py` can still see the trail.

   So `tests/run.sh` hands every harness a directory of its own and no test can
   reach somebody's diary again. */

   long it has been here, where counting the diary's files would say thirty. On
