/* How it sounds, rather than what it says.

   Three things, and none of them touches the facts. A mood that drifts with the
   hour and the day, so that the same question asked on Monday morning and on
   Friday night does not come back in the same words. An opening that knows the
   history — the first time today, the first time in a week, one o'clock in the
   morning. And the pass that takes the assistant out of the assistant: no
   compliment before the answer, no second sentence that says the first one
   again.

   The last of those is the one with evidence behind it. Models are trained to
   agree and to flatter — "great question" before the answer, a closing sentence
   restating the opening one — and it reads as machinery every time. The
   instructions ask for none of it; this is what happens when they are ignored,
   which is often enough to be worth code. */

   Machines are unnerving in proportion to the *experience* people ascribe to
   them, more than to how they look: a thing that seems to feel is the uncanny
   direction, and a pet that says it feels neglected is also a manipulation. The
   cat may go quiet, sit differently, look away; it does not report feelings it
   does not have. Identity is not a feeling — "sono un gatto di pixel" is fine. */
