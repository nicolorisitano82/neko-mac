/* How long "fra dieci minuti" is.

   `NSDataDetector` parses absolute dates out of ordinary sentences in all four of
   this application's languages, for nothing, with no model and no permission:
   *"domani alle 15"* arrives as a date. Measured on this Mac before any of this
   was written, it parses **none** of these:

       metti un timer di 10 minuti · ricordamelo fra 20 minuti · svegliami tra
       un'ora · fra un'ora e mezza · tra un quarto d'ora · tra mezz'ora · 90
       secondi · set a timer for 10 minutes · remind me in 20 minutes · in half an
       hour · in an hour and a half · dans 20 minutes · en media hora

   So this is the small, closed, testable piece that was missing. It is deliberately
   not clever: a number, a unit, and the handful of words four languages use for a
   half and a quarter. Everything it does not recognise is nothing, which is the
   right answer far more often than a guess would be — the failure that matters is
   not a missed timer, it is a timer nobody asked for. */

   than two lists that drift apart. */
