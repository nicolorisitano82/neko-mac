   Deliberately a separate program rather than a linked library. Stable
   Diffusion is reached through stable-diffusion.cpp, which carries its own copy
   of ggml, and the app already has one inside llama.cpp: linked together they
   would be two definitions of every ggml symbol. A helper in the bundle also
   means a model that wanders off into a gigabyte of memory, or crashes, takes
   nothing of the cat with it.
