/* One line to type, beside the cat.

   The other half of being answerable. Speaking is quicker, but it is not always
   available: an open-plan office, a meeting, a Mac with the microphone denied,
   or a word the recogniser will never get right. Holding the keystroke opens
   this instead — a single field, Return to send, Escape to forget it.

   Unlike the bubble, this one has to take the keyboard focus: there is no way to
   type into a window that cannot become key. It gives the focus back to whatever
   application had it, which is the least it can do for having taken it. */
