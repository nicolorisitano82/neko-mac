/* Music and Spotify, spoken to directly.

   Both publish a scripting dictionary, and a sandboxed application may use it
   with com.apple.security.temporary-exception.apple-events naming the two bundle
   identifiers and nothing else. That was measured before it was designed: a
   throwaway bundle signed exactly like this one read Music's volume, set it and
   put it back, counted the library, and read Spotify's player state and current
   track. All of it from inside the sandbox.

   The alternative was a Shortcut per command, which is what 2.6 shipped and what
   somebody rightly complained about: "alza il volume" answering that a Shortcut
   they had never heard of was missing.

   What a plugin gets is a player and a command, both from closed lists. It never
   supplies a line of AppleScript — the scripts live here, in the app, where they
   can be read. A plugin that could hand over script text would be a plugin that
   runs code, which is the one thing this design has refused since it started. */
