/* One plugin folder, read but never run.

   A plugin is a folder with a manifest and some files. The manifest is the whole
   of the contract: what it says it extends is what it may be asked, and nothing
   else about it is consulted. A plugin that did not declare Feeds cannot add a
   feed however many feed addresses its files contain.

   Nothing here loads code. The app is sandboxed and holds a microphone, a
   location, folders somebody handed over by name and a diary about their working
   life; code inside this process would inherit all of it, and the entitlement
   that makes such loading possible is the one that would make the sandbox
   decorative. So a plugin is data, or — later, and only if something needs it —
   a separate process. See docs/plugins.md. */
