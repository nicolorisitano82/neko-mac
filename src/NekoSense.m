#pragma mark What the diary taught this file

/* The clock, read back.

   The suggestion prompt says, in so many words, never to open with the time or
   the date unless it was what was asked. Eight days of real diary say it was
   ignored 22 times in one corpus, so it is a check now and not a request. An
   instruction is not a filter, which this project has now learned twice.

   Precise on purpose: it looks for **the time it is** and **the date it is**,
   not for any time and any date. So "l'orario attuale 10:44" said at 10:44 goes,
   and "alle 18:30 hai la riunione" stays — a remark about something later is a
   remark, and rejecting it would cost more than the failure does. */

/* An explanation of something the cat never saw.

   **This started out wider and was narrowed by its own negative table**, which is
   the outcome docs/personality-roadmap.md named as the thing that would stop this
   stage. The first version threw away any remark that named nothing on the
   screen, and it worked on the failures — and it also threw away *"una pausa ti
   conviene"*, *"sei concentrato"* and *"alle 18:30 hai la riunione"*. A gate that
   silences ordinary advice is worse than the failure it prevents, so it does not
   ship in that shape.

   What is left targets the family that actually filled a real diary, and it is
   the conjunction of two things: the remark **explains** something — *perché*,
   *because*, *parce que*, *porque* — and **nothing it names was in front of it**.
   *"Build lento perché progetto grande"* has no build and no project in anything
   the cat was shown. *"Xcode è lento perché ci lavori da quarantadue minuti"*
   names two things it saw and stays.

   What it therefore does **not** catch, said plainly: a bare invention with no
   explaining word in it — *"test chiatta ancora attivo"* — and a cause carried by
   grammar rather than by a conjunction — *"il progetto è grande e la compilazione
   ne soffre"*. The first is what -alreadySaidToday: is for, since an invention
