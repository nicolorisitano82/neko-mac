   It runs only in the roaming behaviour — a cat that chases the cursor has its
   attention elsewhere, and one living on the Dock is already busy — and only
   when the switch in the preferences is on.

   What it knows is deliberately shallow and needs no permission at all: which
   application is in front, how long you have been in it, how often you have been
   switching, whether you are at the keyboard, and the time of day. Window titles
   are read only if this Mac has already granted screen recording to Neko for
   some other reason; the permission is never asked for. Nothing is read from
   inside your documents, and nothing is stored beyond the last line it said. */
