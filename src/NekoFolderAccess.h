/* Which of your folders the cat has been shown, and how it remembers.

   The app is sandboxed, and measured from a signed build it cannot read the
   Desktop or write to Documents: that is the sandbox doing its job. The way in
   that does not involve giving it up is the one macOS provides — you pick the
   folder yourself, once, in a panel, and the app keeps a security-scoped
   bookmark to it. Nothing else opens that door: not a setting, not a model, not
   a sentence somebody typed into a window.

   Six folders can ever be asked for, and no others. */
