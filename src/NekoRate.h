/* How often the cat may speak unasked, as a budget for the day rather than a
   timer.

   A colleague says something eight to fifteen times a day; a notification says
   it every time a timer expires. The difference is not the average — it is that
   a colleague notices when nobody is listening. So this keeps three things: how
   many remarks today, how they landed, and how much of the day has actually
   been spent at the Mac.

   From those come two answers. Whether it may speak at all right now: not before
   the interval in the preferences, never more than the day's budget, and never
   two in a row far ahead of the day's pace. And how good a moment it has to
   wait for: a wide seam in the work when the day is on pace, a small gap when it
   is behind, which is what lets the rate rise on a quiet day without dropping
   the rule that a remark has to land somewhere.

   The pace itself moves. A remark answered is worth one more a day; one that was
   let go is worth one fewer; one clicked away is worth two, because that is
   somebody saying no rather than somebody being busy. It never goes above
   fifteen — the top of the band a colleague occupies — and never below four,
   which is what consistently being ignored ought to earn. */
