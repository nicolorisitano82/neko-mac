   provider, and the feature is complete: everything else — the catalogue, the
   download, the file on disk, the settings — is already here.

   The intended implementation is llama.cpp built as a static library and linked
   into the app, reading the GGUF the store downloaded. That keeps the app
   self-sufficient at runtime: no daemon to install, no Python, no other
   application to keep running. */

   characters of notes and the default budget of 200 tokens runs out inside them,
   so the answer never begins. Asked "che ore sono?" it writes `<think></think>`
   with nothing between and answers in one line. It is not a switchable habit —

/* A reasoning model's scratchpad, taken out of what it said.

   Reported from use, and it is the worst thing that has been visible in this
   application: asked for Apple's share price, the cat answered with

       <think> Thinking Process: 1. **Analyze Request:** * **Role:** fox living
       someone's computer desktop (quick, sly, pleased own cleverness). *
       **Task:** Answer que…

   — the model's own notes, in the bubble, with the persona quoted back verbatim.
   Qwen3, Qwen3.5 and every other reasoning build emits a `<think>` block before
   answering, and nothing here took it out. `NekoSense` does not catch it by
   design: it judges the remarks the cat makes on its own, never an answer to a
   question, because dropping an answer would leave somebody who asked staring at
   a cat.

   The cause was a catalogue entry added without asking what the model **writes**.
   Its URL, its bytes and its licence were all checked. See `-thinks` on
   NekoLocalModel, which is the other half of this fix.

   Done here rather than at the call sites because there are five of them — the
   question, the unprompted remark, the nightly reflection, the word learning and
   the drawing — and a sixth would forget. This is the engine's own adapter, and
   the scratchpad is the engine's own habit.

   **What it covers:** `<think>`, `<thinking>`, `<thought>` and `<reasoning>`,
   in any case, closed or left open by a budget that ran out — an unclosed block
   takes everything after it, because everything after it is more of the same.
   Not covered: the channel syntax some models use instead (`<|channel|>analysis`),
   which nothing in this catalogue emits and which would be guesswork to write
   against. */
