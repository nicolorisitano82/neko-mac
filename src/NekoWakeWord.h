   This is the one part of the app that holds the microphone open, which is why
   it is a switch of its own rather than a detail of Ask Neko: the orange
   recording light in the menu bar stays on the whole time it runs, and the
   battery notices. What it does with the audio is the important half — the
   recogniser is told to stay on this Mac, and if this Mac cannot recognise the
   language without a server, the feature refuses to run rather than quietly
   streaming a room to one.

   Nothing is written down. The rolling transcript is looked at for one word and
   thrown away, the recognition task is torn down and rebuilt every fifty
   seconds because Speech ends one of its own accord at about a minute, and
   while a question is actually being handled the wake word stops listening
   altogether — otherwise the cat's own answer, read aloud, wakes it up again. */
