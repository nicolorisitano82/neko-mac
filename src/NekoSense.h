/* The last gate before the cat opens its mouth.

   Small models fail in ways that are obvious to a reader and easy to spot in
   code: the same word four times over, an answer in the wrong language, one of
   the example lines handed straight back, a paragraph where a sentence was
   asked for. None of that is worth showing, and a cat that says nothing is
   better than a cat that says "Codice, codice, codice, codice."

   It judges what the cat says on its own, where saying nothing is a perfectly
   good outcome. An answer to a question asked out loud does not come through
   here: dropping that would leave somebody who asked something staring at a
   cat, which is worse than a clumsy sentence.

   Everything here is a rejection, never a repair: a line is shown as written or
   not at all. */

/* The same, judged also against **what the cat could actually see** when it said

   One check needs that and cannot be made without it, and it is here because of
   a measurement rather than a hunch — and it is **narrower than it started**,
   because its own negative table said so: see -explainsSomethingItDidNotSee: for
   what it stopped trying to catch and why. `tools/diary.py`, run on eight days of real
   diary, found 65 remarks carrying 11 distinct thoughts, and the content was:

       build lento perché progetto grande

   The first reads the clock back — which the suggestion prompt **already
   forbids**, in so many words, and which happened 22 times anyway. The second
   names nothing that was on the screen: there is no "build" and no "progetto" in
   anything the cat was shown. `tests/persona.m` produced two more of that family
   the same afternoon, unprompted: *"il build è lento perché i server sono
   sovraccarichi"* — there are no servers.

   Both are in Völkel et al.'s tenth factor for conversational agents, the one
   they named *Artificial*, whose top twenty descriptors include **vague**,
   **superficial** and **monotonous** — an instrument built from 349 adjectives
   rated by 744 people rather than from our own judgement. See
   docs/personality.md §3.
