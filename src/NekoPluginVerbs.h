/* Phrases a plugin asked to hear, matched by the app and never by a model.

   The reasoning is the one the news feeds measured the hard way: asked to read a
   feed, a 4B model invented a headline about Milan, and a 1.5B repeated the
   question back. So intent is recognised here, in code, before any engine is
   consulted — the same place "che notizie ci sono" is recognised.

   What a verb may do is two things, both of which the app could already do and
   neither of which needs a new permission: open an address from a closed list of
   schemes, or run one of the user's own Shortcuts. And it happens only after the
   deed has been read back and somebody has said yes. */

/* The best match for what somebody said, or nil. Longest phrase wins, so

       Argument    what followed the phrase, trimmed — may be empty
       Sentence    the Confirm line with the argument in it, ready to show */
