   They live inside the app's container, because the app is sandboxed and that is
   where it can actually read. That has a consequence worth saying out loud: a
   plugin cannot be installed by dragging it into a folder in the Finder the way a
   character can. So installing is a panel — the same NSOpenPanel handover the
   folder access already uses — and this class is what does the copying. */

   That last part is the one exception to "arriving is not the same as being on",
   and it is deliberate: a plugin that ships with the app is not a folder somebody
   downloaded, and the news feeds it carries are the ones the app has always had.
   Arriving switched off would mean the news simply stopped working on the day
   they moved out of the code.

   Switched on once, and never again. Somebody who turns one off finds it still
   off after the next launch, and after the next update — that is the whole point
   of the switch. */
