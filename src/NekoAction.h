/* One thing the cat is allowed to do, parsed out of a model's answer.

   The list of verbs is closed and short, and anything that does not match it
   exactly is refused rather than interpreted. There is no shell here, no
   arbitrary path, no wildcard, nothing that deletes or overwrites: this round
   opens applications, addresses and folders, and runs a Shortcut you wrote
   yourself — which is the escape hatch for everything else, because a Shortcut
   is your own code that you authorised, not something a model invented.

   The second round adds copying and moving a file between your own folders,
   which the sandbox will not allow until you have handed the folder over in a
   panel: `needsFolders` says which ones are still missing so they can be asked
   for. Nothing here overwrites — a name already taken is given a number — and
   nothing here deletes.

   Nothing is ever performed without being shown first. `summary` is what the
   bubble says before the Yes, in the language the app is running in. */
